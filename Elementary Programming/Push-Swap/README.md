# Push-Swap

{EPITECH.} first year project.

You must create a program in which l_a is given as parameter (all numbers are valid and can fit in an integer). The goal is to sort the list by using the fewest possible operations.
The program must print the series of operations that enable this list to be sorted.

# Used in this program:

• pa
take the first element from l_b and move it to the first position on the l_a list (nothing will happen if l_b is empty).

• pb
take the first element from l_a and move it to the first position on the l_b list (nothing will happen if l_a is empty).

• ra
rotate l_a toward the beginning, the first element will become the last.

# Compilation

run make to build the push_swap executable file.
